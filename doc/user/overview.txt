The model PyRATP was designed to simulate the spatial distribution of radiation and leaf-gas 
exchanges within vegetation canopies as a function of canopy structure, 
canopy microclimate and physical and physiological leaf 
properties. The model uses a 3D representation of the canopy (i.e. an array 
of 3D voxels, each characterised by a leaf area density) and allows several 
vegetation types to be input at voxel scale.
Radiation transfer is computed by a turbid medium analogy, transpiration by 
the leaf energy budget approach, and photosynthesis by the Farquhar model, 
each applied for sunlit and shaded leaves at the individual 3D cell-scale. 
Principes and main equations of the RATP model are given in: Sinoquet et al.,
